# 🛡️ Rust System Event Logger

A powerful system-level keylogger and event tracker built in Rust for Windows. This tool logs keyboard input, mouse events, clipboard updates, and window switches — useful for building introspective journaling tools, personal productivity analytics, or security audit systems.
